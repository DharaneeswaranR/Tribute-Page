      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>23 June</strong> - Alan Mathison Turing was born in London
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>1926</strong> - Aged 14, he was sent to Sherborne School in
            Dorset. His first day of term coincided with the 1926 General
            Strike. Turing was so determined not to miss his first day of school
            that he cycled the 97km from his home in Southampton. His teachers
            worried that he leaned too heavily towards maths and science, at the
            expense of the classics. The headmaster wrote to his parents: "If he
            is to be solely a scientific specialist, he is wasting his time at a
            public school".
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>1927</strong> - At the age of 16, Turing got to grips with
            Albert Einstein's work and extrapolated Einstein's questioning of
            Newton's Laws of Motion from a text in which this was never made
            explicit.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>1930</strong> - Turing's close school friend Christopher
            Morcom dies suddenly from bovine tuberculosis. Turing renounces his
            religious faith and becomes an atheist.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>1931</strong> - Turing goes to study Mathematics at King's
            College, Cambridge.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>1936</strong> - Turing published his paper On Computable
            Numbers and an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem (decision
            problem) in which he outlines the Universal Machine, which later
            became known as the Turing Machine. This was an idealised computing
            device that is capable of performing any mathematical computation
            that can be represented as an algorithm.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>1936-1938</strong> - Turing spent time at Princeton in the
            US studying under Alonzo Church. There he started to study
            cryptology as well as mathematics. In 1938 he received his PhD; his
            dissertation was called Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals and
            introduced original logic and relative computing.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>September 1938</strong> - Turing started to work part-time
            at the Government Code and Cypher School.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>1939</strong> - The day after war is declared in September
            1939, Turing arrives at Bletchley Park. There he works with Gordon
            Welchman to develop the Bombe, a device for decrypting the messages
            sent by Germans using their Enigma machines. The Bombe built on a
            machine that the Polish had already made, called the Bomba
            Kryptlogiczna. Turing used statistical techniques to optimise the
            trial of different possibilities in the code-breaking process using
            probability.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>1941</strong> - Turing proposes to his co-worker Joan
            Clarke, a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst. Shortly after,
            Turing had second thoughts, admitting to his fiancee that he was
            homosexual.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>1942</strong> - Turing sent to the US as part of an
            intelligence collaboration. He shared what he knew about Enigma in
            return for being allowed to inspect the speech encryption system
            being set up to allow conversations between Churchill and Roosevelt
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>1941-1943</strong> - Turing and colleagues manage to break
            the more complicated German Naval Enigma system. This is extremely
            helpful for the Allies during the Battle of the Atlantic as it could
            help them avoid the fearsome German U-boats, which had been
            responsible for sinking more than 700 Allied ships with 2.3 million
            tons of vital cargo.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>1945</strong> - At the end of World War II, Turing is
            awarded an OBE for his services to his country
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>1949</strong> - Turing became deputy director of the
            Computing Laboratory at Manchester University, working on software
            for one of the earliest stored program computers -- the Manchester
            Mark 1. He also explored the problem of artificial intelligence and
            proposed an experiment (in his seminal paper Computing Machinery and
            Intelligence) which became that attempted to define a standard for
            machine intelligence, which would later become known as the Turing
            test.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>January 1952</strong> - Turing meets a man called Arnold
            Murray and invites him over to his house. Murray visits Turing's
            house on a number of occasions, staying the night. Murray later
            helps an accomplice break into Turing's house. Turing reports the
            crime and admits having a sexual relationship with Murray.
            Homosexual acts are illegal in the UK and so both were charged with
            gross indecency. Turing is given the choice of being imprisoned or
            chemically castrated with oestrogen hormone injections. He chooses
            the latter. Turing's conviction means his security clearance is
            removed which means he is barred from his cryptopgraphic consultancy
            for the British government.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>08 June 1954</strong> - Turing's cleaner finds him dead. It
            appears that Turing poisoned himself using a cyanide-laced apple.
